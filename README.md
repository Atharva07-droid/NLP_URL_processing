# NLP_URL_processing
Textual Data Extraction and NLP from websites


The objective of this project was to extract textual data articles from a given URL and perform text analysis to derive various variables such as positive score, negative score, fog index, complex word count, pronoun count, and others.

Additionally, the project aimed to analyze the-sentimental opinion, sentiment scores, readability, passive words, personal pronouns, and other relevant factors from a set of websites that were extracted from a CSV file. The final analysis results were stored in an Excel or CSV file for further reference.
